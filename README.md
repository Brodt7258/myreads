# MyReads Project

This should provide a simple way for users to keep track of books by assigning them to one of three lists

## TL;DR

To run this yourself:

* clone the project to your local machine with `git clone https://github.com/Brodt7258/myreads.git`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
